## Headcrab: July 2020 progress report

About 3 weeks ago, we [started a new project](http://nbaksalyar.github.io/2020/07/12/soul-of-a-new-debugger.html) to create a new modular and composable debugger library for Rust, taking inspiration from projects such as [Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) and [MDB](https://illumos.org/books/mdb/preface.html). In less than 4 weeks, we have already seen some exciting progress!

</figure>

We have started with the basics: launching debuggee processes, reading & writing memory, reading & writing CPU registers, and reading debug symbols -- doing these right is an essential prerequisite before progressing towards more complex features such as breakpoints. And there's a lot of hidden complexity in these functions, as every target platform has its own quirks and requires a separate implementation. Providing a unified, simple API to hide these quirks from a user is one of our goals for the phase 1.

Overall, there were 32 pull requests adding the following features:

- [#57](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/57) added a simple REPL/command line example (the one you see on the screen shot above!), and [#58](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/58) added some more commands.
- [#22](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/22), [#29](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/29), [#32](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/32), [#33](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/33), [#49](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/49) added new abstractions & tests for reading debuggee's memory.
- [#52](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/52) implemented a `ptrace` fallback for reading protected memory on Linux.
- [#40](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/40) added support for reading registers from a target process on Linux.
- [#62](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/62) implements a kill-on-exit function to make sure that processes started by the debugger don't linger on in the suspended state.
- [#59](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/59) added support for debugging [position-independent executables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code#Position-independent_executables).
- [#56](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/56) implemented helper functions to perform system calls in the context of a debuggee on Linux.
- [#47](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/47) added new functions to get a list of threads from a debuggee process.
- [#43](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/43) implemented the attach function to debug already running processes.
- [#6](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/6) implemented the basic debugger functions for the macOS target.
- [#12](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/12) started, and [#46](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/46) significantly improved implementation for reading DWARF debug symbols.
- [#15](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/15), [#19](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/19), [#25](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/25) added more documentation & guides for new contributors.
- [#2](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/2), [#5](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/5/files), [#14](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/14), [#24](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/24), [#23](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/23), [#27](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/27), [#45](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/45), and [#28](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/28) set up the build automation & continuous integration on Linux, macOS, and FreeBSD.
- [#3](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/3) implemented functions to launch a new debuggee process.

## What's next?

Here's a glimpse of what we'll be working on in the near term:

- Stack unwinding and backtraces. The implementation is already started with the pull request [#61](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/61).
- Disassembling code. This is already started by bjorn3 in [#54](https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab/pull/54) and currently it's blocked by a dependency issue.
- Setting breakpoints and catching events, crashes, and signals occuring in a debuggee process.
- As not all of the functions listed above are implemented for macOS, there's a lot of catching up to do.
- Reading & writing thread-local variables.
